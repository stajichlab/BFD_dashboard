-- extra_views.sql: helper views for the local BFD.duckdb. Each view removes a join or a trap that
-- repeats in the BFD_dashboard analyses (evidence: REPORT.md section 4).
-- Run after build_BFD_duckDB.sh AND after compat_views.sql (v_genome_labels reads the `samples` view):
--     duckdb BFD.duckdb < compat_views.sql
--     duckdb BFD.duckdb < extra_views.sql
-- No statement in this file reads a parquet path directly, so the TABLES_DIR line is informative only.
-- All statements are idempotent. Nothing is materialized. No view reads swissprot_hits.
-- Tested 2026-11-11 with DuckDB CLI 1.1.3 and python duckdb 1.5.5 (timings in REPORT.md section 6).
--
-- Genome key: per-genome views (v_genome_*) use LOCUSTAG, as species and v_species_summary do.
-- Views with one row per protein or per family keep species_prefix, as their source tables do.

-- gene_* (docs/analyses/kickxellomycota/README.md:447-457, kingdom_domains/README.md:48). On pfam,
-- gene_proteins, gene_transcripts, gene_exons, gene_CDS, gene_introns and gene_trna the species_prefix column
-- is computed by the view, so a filter on it reads every row group. This macro expands to a range on the
-- sorted id column, which DuckDB pushes into the parquet scan.
--   SELECT * FROM pfam WHERE in_genome(protein_id, 'F07D2B4E');
--   SELECT * FROM gene_introns WHERE in_genome(transcript_id, 'F07D2B4E');
-- '`' is the ASCII character after '_', so the range holds exactly the ids that start with '<LOCUSTAG>_'.
